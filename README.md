- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to David's project corner. As a passionate full-stack developer with experience in building robust and scalable applications, my expertise lies in Python, Java, Javascript, and AI/ML pipelines. I'm always eager to learn and traverse the latest trends in the tech industry.
- ðŸ‘€ Fun fact about me: Singing helps me identify bugs. Why? I don't even know. Maybe it is just about work-life balance, making it essential to mind your pace within the scope of work.
- ðŸŒ± I am interested in and exploring Data Mining and Machine Learning world. It would be nice to have a chat about these emerging topics with someone having the same interests and concerns. I am also open to discuss related or even new research opportunities.
