- ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to David's project corner. As a passionate full-stack developer with experience in building robust and scalable applications, my expertise lies in Python, Java, Javascript, and AI/ML pipelines. I'm always eager to learn and traverse the latest trends in the tech industry.
- ðŸ‘€ Fun fact about me: I love singing. Singing actually helps me relax while, let's say, debugging a program. Why? I don't even know. Maybe it just has something to do with work-life balance, making it essential to mind your own pace for the sake of efficiency.
- ðŸŒ± I am interested in and exploring Data Mining and Machine Learning world. It would be nice to have a chat about these emerging topics with someone having the same interests and concerns. I am also open to discuss related or even new research opportunities.
- ðŸ“« Feel free to explore my repositories and projects, and don't hesitate to reach out @hai.david.vu@gmail.com or Gruhh#5298 on Discord if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. Thanks for visiting and enjoy!
