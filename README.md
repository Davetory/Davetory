- ðŸ‘‹ Xin chao, I am Hoang Hai, or you can call me David. As a passionate and fast learner towards software development with experience in building robust and scalable applications, my expertise lies in Python, Java, Cloud services, AI/ML pipelines and Data Mining techniques. I'm always eager to learn new things and explore the latest trends in the tech industry. I'm committed to writing clean, maintainable, and efficient code that meets the highest industry standards. I'm also a strong believer in open-source software and enjoy contributing to the community by sharing my knowledge and collaborating with other developers.
- ðŸ‘€ Fun fact about me: Singing while debugging helps me spot bugs fast and come up with efficient solutions. Why? Because for me, every application is just as a musical piece, where the structure of a music scale represents a multi-layered issue in which you have to look for the root problem and go through every steps to ensure a complete program is indeed complete. By tailoring every note of the song, you are learning in a tempo-paced rate and paying attention to every detail of the program problems. 
- ðŸŒ± I am interested in and exploring Data Science and Machine Learning at the moment. It would be nice to have a chat about these emerging topics with someone with the same interests. 
- ðŸ“« Feel free to explore my repositories and projects, and don't hesitate to reach out @davetory.vu@gmail.com or Gruhh#5298 on Discord if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project. Thanks for visiting!
